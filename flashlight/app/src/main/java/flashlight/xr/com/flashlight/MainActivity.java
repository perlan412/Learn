     * Called when a key was pressed down and not handled by any of the views

     * to another object) because TextView handles its own key presses.
     * <p/>
     * <p>If the focused view didn't want this event, this method is called.
     * <p/>
     * <p>The default implementation takes care of {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_BACK}
     * by calling {@link #onBackPressed()}, though the behavior varies based
     * on the application compatibility mode: for
     * {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#ECLAIR} or later applications,
     * it will set up the dispatch to call {@link #onKeyUp} where the action
     * will be performed; for earlier applications, it will perform the
     * action immediately in on-down, as those versions of the platform
     * behaved.
     * <p/>

     * if configured with {@link #setDefaultKeyMode}.

    /**
     * Called as part of the activity lifecycle when an activity is going into
     * the background, but has not (yet) been killed.  The counterpart to
     * {@link #onResume}.
     * <p/>
     * <p>When activity B is launched in front of activity A, this callback will
     * be invoked on A.  B will not be created until A's {@link #onPause} returns,
     * so be sure to not do anything lengthy here.
     * <p/>
     * <p>This callback is mostly used for saving any persistent state the
     * activity is editing, to present a "edit in place" model to the user and
     * making sure nothing is lost if there are not enough resources to start
     * the new activity without first killing this one.  This is also a good
     * place to do things like stop animations and other things that consume a
     * noticeable amount of CPU in order to make the switch to the next activity
     * as fast as possible, or to close resources that are exclusive access
     * such as the camera.
     * <p/>
     * <p>In situations where the system needs more memory it may kill paused
     * processes to reclaim resources.  Because of this, you should be sure
     * that all of your state is saved by the time you return from
     * this function.  In general {@link #onSaveInstanceState} is used to save
     * per-instance state in the activity and this method is used to store
     * global persistent data (in content providers, files, etc.)
     * <p/>
     * <p>After receiving this call you will usually receive a following call
     * to {@link #onStop} (after the next activity has been resumed and
     * displayed), however in some cases there will be a direct call back to
     * {@link #onResume} without going through the stopped state.
     * <p/>
     * <p><em>Derived classes must call through to the super class's
     * implementation of this method.  If they do not, an exception will be
     * thrown.</em></p>
